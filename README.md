# Object-Tracking-Drone


This is a code used for tracking objects present in a drone's surrounding. The drone used here is a DJI Tello drone. The drone has a 5 MP camera and can record 720p videos. You can control the drone using your keyboard.


Install the required libraries. I have used Python 3.6. Run Track.py.

The controls are as follow:-
  W- Forward
  A- Ledt
  S- Backwards
  D- Right
  Space- Take Off/ Land
  8- Up
  2- Down
  C- Capture a photo
  Q- Rotate anti-clockwise
  E- Rotate clockwise
